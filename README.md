MIPS Simulator

1.MIPS Simulator

In this project, will create a simple MIPS simulator which will perform the following two tasks: 
(1) Load a specified MIPS text file1 and generate the assembly code equivalent to the input file (disassembler). 
(2) Generate the instruction-by-instruction simulation of the MIPS code (simulator). It should also produce/print the contents of registers and data memories after execution of each instruction.
